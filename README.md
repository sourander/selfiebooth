# selfiebooth
Raspberry Pi 4 selfie booth.

## About
This is a project based on PyImageSearch photo booth and courses from the same site. Intended use: learning more about computer vision and machine learning. 

The Selfie Generator captures selfies, crops them (based on HAAR cascades) and saves the images so that they can be fed to a machine learning algorithm.

Current status: Investigating various algorithms for nice balance between performance and accuracy.
